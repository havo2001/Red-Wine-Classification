# Red Wine Classification
## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the Red Wine Quality dataset, which contains various attributes related to red wine quality. The dataset includes features such as fixed acidity, volatile acidity, citric acid, residual sugar, chlorides, free sulfur dioxide, total sulfur dioxide, density, pH, sulphates, and alcohol. The target variable is the quality of the wine, which is a score between 3 and 8.

## Model
The project includes the following machine learning models:
1. Logistic Regression: This model is used to predict wine quality by fitting a logistic regression classifier to the data.
2. Decision Tree: A decision tree classifier is trained to predict wine quality based on the physicochemical properties.
3. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN): KNN is used to classify wine quality by finding the K-nearest neighbors in the feature space.
